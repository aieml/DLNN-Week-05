# DLNN-Week-05
In this week trained a CNN to identify cat &amp; dogs and tested it with some unseen data. We experienced that the CNN is suffering from over-fitting while training and ended up with a low validation accuracy like 75%. In coming weeks we will discuss about regularization methods for minimizing and avoiding over-fitting such dropout, early stopping, batch normalization and etc. As the 2nd In class project we implemented the NVIDIA self driving car model with Udacity Self Driving Car Simulator.
